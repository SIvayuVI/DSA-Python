# DSA-Python

We are going to see Data Structures and Algorithms paralally and I will use Python language for code implementations.

## Algorithms:

A sequence of finite steps to perform some tasks.

Example : Multiplications of two numbers

Properties of Algorithms:

1. It should terminate after finite amount of times.
2. Produce atleast one output
3. Independent of any programing languages.
4. The output should be deterministic


Steps to construct an Algorithm:

1. Problem definition
2. Design a Algorithm
    a. Divide and Conqure
    b. Greedy Algorithm
    c. Dynamic Programing and many more
3. Draw a flow chart
4. Testing Phase
5. Implementation
6. Analysis
