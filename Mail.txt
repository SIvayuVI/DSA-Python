I hope this email finds you all in good health and high spirits. Today, as I bid farewell to the organization, I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you.

First and foremost, I would like to extend my deepest appreciation to Fis, my first workplace, where I have spent more than five enriching years of my professional journey. It has been an incredible experience to grow and learn in this organization.

During my tenure, I have had the privilege of working with two remarkable managers, Anand and Thyaga. Their guidance, support, and leadership have played a significant role in shaping my career. I am grateful for the opportunities they provided me and the valuable lessons I learned under their mentorship.

I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of the three exceptional team leads I have worked with: Harish, Reuban, and Rex. Their expertise, dedication, and constant encouragement have been instrumental in my professional development. Thank you for guiding our team towards success.

To every manager, team lead, and colleague who has been a part of my journey here, I extend my sincerest appreciation. Your collaboration, cooperation, and camaraderie have made my time at Fis truly memorable. Together, we have tackled challenges, celebrated victories, and fostered a supportive work environment.

I cannot overlook the immense knowledge and skills I have acquired through our project. The learning opportunities were aplenty, and I am grateful for the chance to grow both personally and professionally. Thank you all for being an integral part of this valuable experience.

In particular, I would like to express my special thanks to Rex, Sathish, Sudar, Surya, Darshan, and the entire ETL team. Your dedication, hard work, and camaraderie have made a significant impact on our project's success. It was a pleasure collaborating with all of you, and I will cherish the memories we created together.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to our fantastic Business Analysts and my data modeler, Mani. Your expertise, insights, and meticulous attention to detail have been instrumental in delivering high-quality results. A special thanks goes out to Vignesh, Srikant, and Jon for their continuous support and assistance whenever I needed it.

Lastly, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to Anu and Deepak for being not only well-wishers but also mentors throughout my journey here. Your guidance, encouragement, and belief in my abilities have been invaluable. I am truly grateful for the positive impact you have had on my professional growth.

As I move on to the next chapter of my career, I will carry with me the cherished memories, lessons, and relationships forged during my time at Fis. It has been an honor and a privilege to work with such an amazing group of individuals.
